# public-issues

Welcome to the Arch Network public-issues repository, a place for sharing issues or bugs encountered while developing on Arch.

Within the [issues tab], there are two templates:
- [Bug report]
- [Generic issue]

Choose an issue template that fits your need and follow the guidelines, providing as much detail as you are able to so that the team can triage and provide the necessary comment or fix.
